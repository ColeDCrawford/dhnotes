## Bash

>  Bash/sh/zsh family is brilliant at intense interaction with humans. Aliases, short built-in commands, oneliner-oriented nature, keyboard ergonomics, really concise file/process handling - all of this makes it _the shell_.<sup>1</sup>
  
> The craft of scripting is not hard to master, since scripts can be built in bite-sized sections and there is only a fairly small set of shell-specific operators and options [1] to learn. The syntax is simple -- even austere -- similar to that of invoking and chaining together utilities at the command line, and there are only a few "rules" governing their use. Most short scripts work right the first time, and debugging even the longer ones is straightforward.<sup>2</sup>
