# Device Security at the Border

## Field Reports

February 10, 2017 | "[Canadian Muslim grilled about her faith and view on Trump at US border
stop][1]," *The Guardian*

> She said they also examined her phone and asked questions about Arabic
videos on the device. Alaoui told them they were videos of daily prayers she
had received from friends, to help her and her son as he went through chemo.
An agent later explained that the videos were why she was being blocked from
entry.

January 30, 2017 | "[Travelers Affected By Trump Ban Forced To Unlock Phones,
Computers][3]," *Vocativ*

> President Trump’s confusing, chaotic executive order against travelers
arriving from seven Muslim-majority countries has prompted federal agents to
demand travelers — some of them legal residents — hand over access to their
electronic devices and social media accounts to be searched, their lawyers
say.

September 9, 2013 | "[The Border Is a Back Door for U.S. Device Searches][2],"
*Thee New York Times*

> Newly released documents reveal how the government uses border crossings to
seize and examine travelers’ electronic devices instead of obtaining a search
warrant to gain access to the data.

##  Tactics

1. Security on a scale. Parity of resources. Common breaches:

- State actors, with near unlimited resources.
- Sustained but temporary attention at places like the border.
- Opportunistic agents that target obvious “soft” spots.

2. Attack vectors, vulnerability analysis. Understand your vulnerabilities.
The importance of physical access. Virtual is real. Thinking about location.
Cloud vs. local vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, vs. social vectors.

3. Hardening. Common strategies. Two factor authentication. Encryption.

4. Obfuscation. Multiple accounts. Separating work from personal, by year, or place. Cheap disposable devices.  

5. Operational security and hygiene. Security is a practice, not something to
be done once. Good habits:

- Using multiple accounts / platforms
- Logging out
- Two factor authentication
- Prevent password dependencies
- Limit use of social media

6. Canary. Buddy system. Currier drops. Backups.

7. Dry runs. Wipe and restore phone and laptop accounts. Institute a protocol.
Review it with a friend and/or expert. Practice before traveling, when not
under duress.

8. Limiting access. Travel devices.
