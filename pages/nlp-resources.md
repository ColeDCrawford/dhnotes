A list of NLP tools with an emphasis on the command line.

- [AlchemyCmd](http://www.alchemyapi.com/developers/tools/alchemycmd) is a command-line tool for performing natural language processing and text analysis on Linux/Unix systems.
- [Awk and Sed for Language Analysis](http://awk.info/?textmine/languageAnalysis)
- "Combining the Bourne-shell, sed and awk in the UNIX
environment for language analysis" by Lothar M. Schmitt and Kiel T. Christianson. [Original](http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/share/pdf/languageAnalaysis.pdf),  [mirror](https://github.com/dh-notes/dhnotes/blob/master/documents/languageAnalaysis.pdf).
- [dbacl](http://dbacl.sourceforge.net/) is a command line text classifier. It’s uses bigrams for features and, as far as I can tell (I’ve only skimmed the source) builds a maximum entropy model for classification. I’ve only played with it a little bit, but my impressions so far are that it’s easy to use, fast and produces high quality results.
- [Hunpos](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hunpos/) is an open source reimplementation of TnT, the well known part-of-speech tagger by Thorsten Brants.
- [Libtextcat](http://software.wise-guys.nl/libtextcat/) is a library with functions that implement the classification technique described in Cavnar & Trenkle, "N-Gram-Based Text Categorization." It was primarily developed for language guessing, a task on which it is known to perform with near-perfect accuracy.
- [Sentences - A command line sentence tokenizer in Go](https://github.com/neurosnap/sentences).
- [TextBlob: Simplified Text Processing](https://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/)
