## attack vector

> An attack vector is a path or means by which a hacker (or cracker) can gain
access to a computer or network server in order to deliver a payload or
malicious outcome. Attack vectors enable hackers to exploit system
vulnerabilities, including the human element.

## threat modeling

> In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded).

## hardening

> Hardening your computer is an important step in the fight to protect your personal data and information. This process works to eliminate means of attack by patching threats and turning off inessential services. Hardening a computer involves several steps to form layers of protection. It involves using antivirus and antispyware protection, regularly downloading the latest manufacturers patches, and disabling unneeded software and applications, making computers harder to break into.
