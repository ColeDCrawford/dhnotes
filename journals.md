ELUDAMOS positions itself as a publication that fundamentally transgresses disciplinary boundaries. The aim is to join questions about and approaches to computer games from decidedly heterogeneous scientific contexts (for example cultural studies, media studies, (art) history, sociology, (social) psychology, and semiotics) and, thus, to advance the interdisciplinary discourse on digital games. This approach does not exclude questions about the distinct features of digital games a an aesthetic and cultural form of articulation, on the contrary, the issue is to distinguish their media specific characteristics as well as their similarity to other forms of aesthetic and cultural practice. That way, the editors would like to contribute to the lasting distinction of international game studies as an academic discipline.

The journal is closely  aligned with the new field of research which is alternatively referred  to as humanities computing, social informatics, or informatica  umanistica. We welcome contributions from the humanities, the social,  behavioural, and natural sciences, as well as technology. Human IT  aspires to be a forum for new research which risks falling outside of  the borders of intra-disciplinary channels of publication as a result of  its multi-disciplinary approach or unorthodox choice of subject.

However, the journal's scope has been broadened significantly beyond these areas to include the historical study of any topic that would fall under the purview of any of the modern interdisciplinary schools of information, such as the school in which the journal is edited, the School of Information at The University of Texas at Austin. In keeping with the spirit of the information schools, the work is human centered and looks at the interactions of people, organizations, and societies with information and technologies. Social and cultural context of information and information technology, viewed from an historical perspective, is at the heart of the journal's interests. Typical papers might focus, among other topics, on the histories of information institutions, academic domains, professions, work, and societies. The intention is to juxtapose papers on a wide variety of topics related to the history of information so as to stimulate connections that have not been made, for example between the research of library historians, historians of computing, labor historians, gender historians, economic historians, business historians, political and diplomatic historians, cultural studies scholars, critical theorists, and science and technology scholars.

[**New Directions in the Humanities**](http://thehumanities.com/publications/journal) provide a space for dialogue and publication of new knowledge which builds on the past traditions of the humanities whilst setting a renewed agenda for their future. The humanities are a domain of learning, reflection and action, and a place of dialogue between and across epistemologies, perspectives and content areas. It is in these unsettling places that the humanities might be able to unburden modern knowledge systems of their restrictive narrowness. Discussions in the New Directions in the Humanities Collection range from the broad and speculative to the microcosmic and empirical. Their over-riding concern, however, is to redefine our understandings of the human and mount a case for the disciplinary practices of the humanities. At a time when the dominant rationalisms are running a course that often seem to draw humanity towards less than satisfactory ends, these journals reopen the question of the human—for highly pragmatic as well as redemptory reasons.
