## What is a programming language?

control structures + data types + built-in functions

## Why Python?

- easy to learn
- human-friendly
- domain general
- friendly community
- a huge number of domain-specific libraries
- commercial support


## Types & Variables

```
$ python
a = "hello world!"
b = 57
c = 75
d = b + c
d = a + b [!]
type(a)
type(c)
```

## Operator overload & weak typing

```
exit()
$ ipython
a = "hello"
b = "world"
c = a + b
print(c)
```
